      "Misty is a Discord Bot that I created to use in Discord Servers to announce when my stream or a friends stream goes live. Loosely inspired by the fictional character, Misty, from the 'Legend of Heroes' series, this Discord bot uses both Twitch and Discord API Integrations to announce within a Discord server when a streamer goes live on Twitch.",
